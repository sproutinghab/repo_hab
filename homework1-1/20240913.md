## Difference between algorithm and model 
### concept :exclamation:
- Algorithm: <u>a sequence of computational steps</u> that transform the input into the output(From **Introduction to Algorithms** *Third Edition*). Or a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of perations(From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm#Definition)).<u></u>
- Model: describe <u>how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input</u> and <u>how units of computations, emories, and communications are organized</u> (From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation))
### feature :exclamation:
- **Algorithm**: 
  1.clear
  2.ordered
  3.finite
  4.solve spercific mission
- **Model**:
  1.absract
  2.simulation
### example:grey_exclamation:
- Algorithm: Linear regression and logistic regression
- Model: Linear model
